### Now with multitrack support!

AudioMass now ships with a full multitrack mode -- layer multiple tracks, drag clips around, crossfade overlaps, record onto armed channels, and bounce the whole thing back down to a single file. More details on the [about page](https://audiomass.co/about.html).

If you want to build the all.build.js minified file for delivery/publishing this then you can use uglify and run as:
```cat dist/wavesurfer.js dist/plugin/wavesurfer.regions.js oneup.js app.js keys.js contextmenu.js lufs.js ui-fx.js ui.js modal.js state.js engine.js actions.js drag.js recorder.js multitrack.js welcome.js fx-pg-eq.js fx-auto.js local.js id3.js lzma.js | uglifyjs -c -m -o all.build.js```

Thanks!
